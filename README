Reviewer 1: 
This code runs a sccessful app. The 10 differnt colors are displayed with the approtiate link page to them. 
There were no issues in this code. The gadget used was a camera and ran successfuly also. I think in order to link with 
an acctual camera there would need to be some connection between the device and the code made. Overall a successful run of the app.
