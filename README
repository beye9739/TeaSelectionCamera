Reviewer 1: 
This code runs successfuly. The 10 differnt color bands and approtiate pages are linked together. 
The Camera Gadget was used successfully. There is a "show camera" button on the camera tab but when clicked nothing happens. 
I think this might be beacuse the code would need to be linked to the camera for the specific device. Overall well done.
